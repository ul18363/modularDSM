"""
	A way to test the SLE algorithm could be to make it approximate the value of a function given a change in its domain.
	The value of the function would be the sensory input, and the change in the domain would be the motor command.
	 

	 The test would be like S=cos(x)
	 						M = dx

	 						output of SLE: cos(x+dx)-cos(x)
